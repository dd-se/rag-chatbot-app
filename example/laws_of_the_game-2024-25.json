        "ideal_answer": "When a penalty kick is awarded for a non-deliberate handball offence, the same philosophy should apply as for offences (fouls) which are an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball.

Also, 'handball' has been changed to 'deliberate handball' in the list of offences that might be suitable for a temporary dismissal if they stop or interfere with a promising attack (system B)."
